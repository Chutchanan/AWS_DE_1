brief explanation
•	Utilized AWS Glue Crawler to extract data from S3 and create tables in Athena for querying.
•	Used Python to query data from Athena and load it into a DataFrame for data transformation and analysis.
•	Transformed and loaded the processed data back to S3 using the Boto3 library.
•	Created an ETL job (AWS Glue) using a Python shell script to copy the data from S3 to Redshift, ensuring seamless data transfer and integration.
